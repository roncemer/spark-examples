# Method #1 for distributing the total value for each group to the events in the group based on each event's weight.
# This method builds an RDD with one row for each group, containing the group number, the total value for the group,
# and the list of events in that group.  Then, using that RDD, it calls flatMap() with a lambda which calls a
# function once per group, distributing those function calls across the cluster.  Each function call distributes the
# total value for each group to the events in that group.
# PRO: Pretty fast.
# PRO: Parallelizable on a per-group basis (multiple groups simultaneously being processed on different nodes or
#      processes within the Spark cluster).
# CON: Requires that all of the events for all groups (or at least a given group) fit in memory on the driver node /
#      process, because each successive call to reduceGroups() is combining more and more groups and their events in
#      memory, and the full list is sent back to the driver node / process at the end, and must fit in its memory as
#      a list (not an RDD).  An RDD would be spread across the entire cluster, but a list is just a normal Python
#      object, and must fit in the memory of whatever node / process on which it exists.  In the case of the final
#      reduced list, which is one element (a dict) per group, with another list of events inside each group dict,
#      the entire thing must fit in the memory of the driver node / process.
# NOTE: There is a command-line switch which causes the setup to only keep one group in memory at a time on the
#      driver node/process.  By turning this feature on, the setup takes longer, but it reduces the probability that
#      the driver node / process will run out of memory because it avoids trying to fit all groups and their events
#      into memory simultaneously on the driver node / process.  Instead, it builds one group at a time and
#      immediately converts that group and its events to an RDD which is spread across the cluster, and then appends
#      that RDD to the RDD containing all groups, which is also spread across the cluster.
#      To enable this functionality, add the following to the end of the spark-submit command, after the name of the
#      Spark notebook:
#          --conserve-driver-memory true

# Method #2 for distributing the total value for each group to the events in the group based on each event's weight.
# This method uses Spark SQL and a three-step process:
#     1) Do a rough distribution, ignoring rounding error, using a join query.
#     2) For each group, calculate the rounding error and find the event with the largest absolute value.
#     3) Add the rounding errors to the correct events by using a left join between the rough-distributed events
#        and the rounding error table.
# PRO: Uses Spark SQL to do everything.
# PRO: May scale better across the cluster regardless of the number of groups or actions.
# PRO: Doesn't require a lot of memory on the driver node / process.
# PRO: Doesn't and doesn't require any iteration over groups in the setup (there really is no setup).
