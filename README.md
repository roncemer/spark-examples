## Basic DataFrame handling, reading and writing Parquet and CSV files
This Spark job creates a DataFrame with a schema and some data, create a temporary view, queries the temporary view, saves the results to a single-partition Parquet file, reads the Parquet file, saves to a single-partition CSV file, and reads the CSV file.
```console
./cleanup ; spark-submit src/create_data_frame_read_write_parquet_and_csv.py
```

# Executing calculations in parallel
This Spark job uses flatMap() to execute calculation jobs in parallel across a Spark cluster, passing a lookup table to the workers as a broadcast variable.
```console
spark-submit src/flat_map_with_broadcast_var.py
```

## Clean up output files which were created by demos
